# Better late than sorry!

As an **Electrical and Electronics Engoneering** student, I was a bit  late to get introduced to the platforms, that I wanted to thrive in. As this particular degree in Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU) only focused only their curriculumn on the **Electrical part**. And the **Electronics** subjects were mostly *neglected* or *left out*.

I wasn't into only coding or only hardware aspects. I wanted to see how it worked and came to life in **IRL**, I wanted both *hardware* & *software* for that, there is a thing called hardware and software co-design, it's a topic for the future blogs.

I had this pull towards **computers ,tech and the electronic componenets** inside from my childhood. I used to tear apart remote controlled car to get that DC motor inside.

As I was in pre-final year (Because saying 3rd year doesn't give that kick), I was introduced to the **world of Micro-controllers, SBC's and the maker community**, oh god was I happy?! You should have seen my face.

I've searched for arduino kits online and stumbled upon Quad store's "Super Starter Kit", which comes with a list of projects you can do and also the code, a great start for me.
