# Better late than sorry!

As an **Electrical and Electronics Engineering** student, I was a bit late to get introduced to the platforms I wanted to thrive in. The curriculum at Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU) mainly focuses on **Electrical subjects**, and the **Electronics** part is often *neglected* or *left out*.

I wasn’t only into coding or just hardware. I wanted to see how things actually **worked in real life**. I wanted both *hardware* and *software* together, a concept called **hardware-software co-design**, which is something I’ll cover in future blogs.

_Man of the Show_

I’ve had a fascination with **computers, tech, and electronic components** since childhood. I even used to tear apart remote-controlled cars just to see the DC motors inside.

Being in my pre-final year (because saying “3rd year” doesn’t give the same thrill), I finally got introduced to the **world of microcontrollers, single-board computers (SBCs), and the maker community**. Oh, the joy! You should have seen my face.

_Just a depiction_

I searched online for Arduino kits and stumbled upon Quad Store's **"Super Starter Kit"**, which came with project guides and sample code, a perfect start for a beginner like me.

</div>

This included every possible componenets I didn't know I needed, untill I started doing projects, really a great kit.

### Components Included

_The components of the kit_

The Kit included:
* Arduino Uno R3
* Breadboard (Full-size)
* Breadboard (Mini)
* Expansion Shield
* Push Buttons
* ULN2003 Driver
* Stepper Motor
* Breadboard power supply
* IR Remote
* Battery Holder
* Vibration switch
* flame sensor
* DHT11 sensor
* Photo-resistor
* IR Receiver
* Potentiometer
* 16*2 LCD (Without I2C module)
* Active Buzzer
* Passive Buzzer
* HC SR04
* IC 74HC595
* 1 Digit Display
* 4 Digit Display
* 8*8 Dot Matrix
* Resistors (220, 330, 10k and 1k ohms)
* Jumper wires
* RGB Module
* LEDs
* 40 pin Header
* Jumpers (F-F and M-M)
* SG90 Servo motor

Almost around 20 components, trust me, I didn't know what they did, when I bought them, I've figured it out, you'll figure it out somehow too.

Somehow, that kid who tore apart remote-control cars just to see the DC motors at work came back to life when he saw Stepper and Servo motors. Talk about a step-up!
