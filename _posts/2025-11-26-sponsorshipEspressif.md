# A trip to the past

27th April 2025, that's the day I started the club, VEDA - VLSI & Embedded Design Association, after typing letter after letter addressing HOD of our department (Electrical and Electronics). I had this urge, this stupidly strong urge, to do things people wouldn't dare to attempt, and still today that same urge is very much alive. As Albert Camus said "I rebel therefore I exist".

>I'll make a seperate blog talking about VEDA.

# Reality kicks In

We as a club were not resourceful, didn't have any hardware equipments, boards and books, we couldn't ask college to contribute, this was a student led initiative, if the college enters the picture, we'll be held accountable for every component we break, short-circuit & burnt resistors while we tinker, I wanted my club members to break things, Because that's the only way I know how to learn. 

>If you have ever opened up a device just to see what's inside, or taken apart something that was working perfectly fine, to see the heart of the machine, then you know exactly what I mean.

So I started contacting every company I know, started sending them emails, still sending, many didn't sponsor, many didn't reply and some cared, and among them is Espressif.
