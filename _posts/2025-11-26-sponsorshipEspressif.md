# A trip to the past

27th April 2025, that's the day I started the club, VEDA - VLSI & Embedded Design Association, after typing letter after letter addressing HOD of our department (Electrical and Electronics). I still remember the urge to do things that everyone couldn't possibly dream of, and the urge is still the same.

>I'll make a seperate blog talking about VEDA.

We as a club were not resourceful, didn't have any hardware equipments, boards and books, we couldn't ask college to contribute, this was a student led initiative, if the college enters the picture, we'll be held responsible for every component we break, short-circuit while we tinker, I wanted my club members to break things, the only way I know how to learn is to turn the things inside out. So I started contacting every company I know, started sending them emails, still sending, many didn't sponsor, many didn't reply and some cared, and among them is Espressif.
