# ESP32 - An Uprade?

I have already got an <a href="https://samarthhgowdaa.github.io/posts/Arduino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arduino</a> and some-what have a grasp on how things work with it, so the first sane thing to do after getting an ESP32 development kit is to plug it to my computer and dump a code then see it work, right? Nope, thanks to Espressif and Jocelyn Zhang who sponsored me <a href="https://samarthhgowdaa.github.io/posts/sponsorshipEspressif/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 ESP32 development kits</a>. Particulary two types of them and those boards are:

*  ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1
*  ESP32-C3 DevKitM-1

After getting my hands on these guys, a few questions and doubts started appearing, I mean a lot of doubts and definitely a lot of questions. I'm going to phrase some of them here:

* What makes an ESP32 different from an Arduino?
* Are there any other micro-controllers except Arduino and ESP32?
* Aren't the three boards same?
* What is with their naming convention?
* When and Why do I need to use an ESP32?

It kept going on and on and on, the questions never stopped. As an engineer, I started tackling them one by one and it took me a lot of time to get answers, but here I am. Skip to [the beginning](#the-begining) if you are already well aquainted with all these.


## ESP32 v/s ATMega328
---

Arduino is not a micro-controller, while ATMega328 is, so it's basically **ATMega328 v/s ESP32**, So before even touching the ESP32, I had to get an answer for the most basic question:

>"Why should I use an ESP32, when I already have an Arduino (I mean ATMega328)?"

It turns out that, it wasn't just an upgrade but this was on a whole new level, talk about over-kill, running web servers, trying to control another ESP32, RTOS, what the hell am I witnessing?! Thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Robonyx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robonyx</a> and his video about <a href="https://youtu.be/RiYnucfy_rs?si=d_afieImDAPqOhnF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arduino to ESP32: How to Get Started</a> on YouTube, and some other resources I got to look at on the internet from <a href="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/getting-started-with-esp32/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Random nerd tutorials</a> and <a href="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/getting-started-with-esp32/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Espressif</a>. Okay, okay I'll stop citing sites I've used (for now) and get to the point, tabular colums do work, but let me take a different approach.

* ESP32 is faster, more modern and can handle complex tasks without breaking a sweat (from a 8-bit to 32-bit processor, uff).
* ESP32 is made for IoT (Internet of Things) & Arduino is not (Not without external modules).
* ESP32 can run big programs, APIs, web servers, with more RAM & more FLASH.
* ESP32 has Analog output, Better DAC, PWM on every pin (almost), timers, Hardware encryption, the tools for a proper embedded system projects.
* ESP32 is Industry standard for low power electronics, which is 3.3v
* Not so easy learning curve (for me)

>I'm comparing the ESP32 to Arduino UNO R3, the Arduino board I have, the only Arduino board I have
{: .prompt-info}

So here's a table, plotting the difference between ESP32 and Arduino UNO R3 (I mean ATMega328).

## Any Other Micro-controllers?
---

After a series of searching and asking my friends (*ahem ChatGPT), I got to know that there are a few other micro-controllers which are same but are beefed up in other parts of working/Utilities, let me name some of them.

### STM32 

<a href="[STM32]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">STM32</a> is a family of 32-bit ARM Cortex microcontrollers made by STMicroelectronics. They are far more powerful than Arduino UNO and often used in industry-grade embedded systems.

_STM32 Micro-controller_

### PIC (Peripheral Interface Controller)

PIC is made by [Microchip technology][microChipTechnologies]{: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, these are 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers used in:
* Appliances
* Automotive control
* Industrial applications
* Power electronics
* Old-school embedded systems

This *was* the Arduino of 1990s, before ARM came into the picture.

![PIC][picBoardImages]{: width="auto" height="300" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
_Various older (EPROM) PIC microcontrollers_

That's everything I found, after digging into the topic, so let's move forward.

## What I Got?!
---

They sent me three brand new ESP32 boards, which came in rectangular tight, fancy looking premiumly packaged boxes, which were of 2 different types:
1. ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1
2. ESP32-C3 DevKitM-1

And What's so different about these boards?

### ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1

![Front view of ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1][frontViewESP32S3]{: width="auto" height="300" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
_Front view of ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1_

I mean, The **ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1** is a powerful development board built around the ESP32-S3 SoC, which has a dual core Xtensa LX7 processor with WiFi + Bluetooth 5 LE, AI Instructions and tons of GPIOs. Turns out this little guy is the best ESP variant out there for:
* Robotics
* IoT (Not any IoT, High performance IoT)
* Edge ML (Well I can definitely use the [Tiny ML](https://tinymlbook.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} book I've got my hands on)
* Use camera modules
* Audio DSP
* Automation

Impressive isn't it, I was blown away too, when I took a look at the pin layout.

_ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1 Pin layout_

Soo many things, that I can't even comprehend, for now.

Check out their [official documentation][officialDocByEspressif]{: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} by Espressif.

### ESP32-C3 DevKitM-1

![Front view of ESP32-C3 DevKitM-1](/assets/img/ESP32/ESP32-C3%20DevKitM-1/front.png){: width="auto" height="300"}

Not a big guy, but a compact, efficient performer. The **ESP32-C3 DevKitM-1** is a development board powered by the ESP32-C3 SoC - a single-core [RISC-V][riscV]{: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} processor with WiFi + Bluetooth 5 LE, strong security features, and extremely low power consumption. It's like the little brother of S3, the scale and capabilities of this is a bit smaller compared to S3.

Here's a pin diagram for reference

# The Begining

The thing is, as I mentioned in the begining of this blog (see: [ESP32 - An Upgrade?↗](#esp32---an-uprade)), the first thing to do after getting an ESP32 board isn't plugging it into the laptop, dump an example code and see the RGB LED blink. No. The first thing is to under-go a painfull experience that will consume your entire evening figuring stuff out and at the end of it, to only realize that you were stuck in a loop all along (Source: Trust me).
