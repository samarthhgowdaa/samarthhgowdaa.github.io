# ESP32 - An Uprade?

I have already got an <a href="https://samarthhgowdaa.github.io/posts/Arduino/" target="_blank">Arduino</a> and some-what have a grasp on how things work with it, so the first sane thing to do after getting an ESP32 development kit is to plug it to my computer and dump a code then see it work, right? Nope, thanks to Espressif and Jocelyn Zhang who sponsored me <a href="https://samarthhgowdaa.github.io/posts/sponsorshipEspressif/" target="_blank">3 ESP32 development kits</a>. Particulary two types of them and those boards are:

*  ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1
*  ESP32-C3 DevKitM-1

After getting my hands on these guys, a few questions and doubts started appearing, I mean a lot of doubts and definitely a lot of questions. I'm going to phrase some of them here:

* What makes an ESP32 different from an Arduino?
* Are there any other micro-controllers except Arduino and ESP32?
* Aren't the three boards same?
* What is with their naming convention?
* When and Why do I need to use an ESP32?

It kept going on and on and on, the questions never stopped. As an engineer, I started tackling them one by one and it took me a lot of time to get answers, but here I am.


## ESP32 v/s ATMega328
---
Arduino is not a micro-controller, while ATMega328 is, so it's basically **ATMega328 v/s ESP32**, So before even touching the ESP32, I had to get an answer for the most basic question:

>"Why should I use an ESP32, when I already have an Arduino (I mean ATMega328)?"

It turns out that, it wasn't just an upgrade but this was on a whole new level, talk about over-kill, running web servers, trying to control another ESP32, RTOS, what the hell am I witnessing?! Thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Robonyx" target="_blank">Robonyx</a> and his video about <a href="https://youtu.be/RiYnucfy_rs?si=d_afieImDAPqOhnF" target="_blank">Arduino to ESP32: How to Get Started</a> on YouTube, and some other resources I got to look at on the internet from <a href="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/getting-started-with-esp32/" target="_blank">Random nerd tutorials</a> and <a href="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/getting-started-with-esp32/" target="_blank">Espressif</a>. Okay, okay I'll stop citing sites I've used (for now) and get to the point, tabular colums do work, but let me take a different approach.

* ESP32 is faster, more modern and can handle complex tasks without breaking a sweat (from a 8-bit to 32-bit processor, uff).
* ESP32 is made for IoT (Internet of Things) & Arduino is not (Not without external modules).
* ESP32 can run big programs, APIs, web servers, with more RAM & more FLASH.
* ESP32 has Analog output, Better DAC, PWM on every pin (almost), timers, Hardware encryption, the tools for a proper embedded system projects.
* ESP32 is Industry standard for low power electronics, which is 3.3v
* Not so easy learning curve (for me)

>I'm comparing the ESP32 to Arduino UNO R3, the Arduino board I have, the only Arduino board I have

So here's a table, plotting the difference between ESP32 and Arduino UNO R3 (I mean ATMega328).
