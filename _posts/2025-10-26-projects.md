# The Beginning

---

The time has finally come to face the real world.  
Out there, a vast crowd is hunting for jobs and seats in esteemed universities and companies.  
So, how do I stand out among them? What skills should I develop and how?

If I look closely enough, I believe I’ll find the answers along the way. Engineering through challenges is what I’ve learned to do best. So, I’ll return to the basics and start building projects.

## The Format

One thing’s certain: I’m going to build.  
But what should each project include?

* Days it took  
* What I learned  
* How it works  
* Why I did it  
* Other possible approaches  
* Conclusion  
* Future improvements  

These will be my guiding points.  
If I ever refine this format, I’ll update it here.

No time to waste, **I’ll begin.**

### A Note on the Journey Ahead

Each project here will be a step forward, from simple circuits to embedded systems, and eventually toward digital design and VLSI concepts.

Through these hands-on explorations, I want to bridge the gap between classroom theory and real-world engineering. So that one day, I get to contribute to the silicon heart of modern technology.
