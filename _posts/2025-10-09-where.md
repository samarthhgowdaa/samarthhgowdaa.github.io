# Better late than sorry!

As an **Electrical and Electronics Engoneering** student, I was a bit  late to get introduced to the platforms, that I wanted to thrive in. As this particular degree in Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU) only focused only their curriculumn on the **Electrical part**. And the **Electronics** subjects were mostly *neglected* or *left out*.

I wasn't into only coding or only hardware aspects. I wanted to see how it worked and came to life in **IRL**, I wanted both *hardware* & *software* for that, there is a thing called hardware and software co-design, it's a topic for the future blogs.

_Man of the Show_

I had this pull towards **computers ,tech and the electronic componenets** inside from my childhood. I used to tear apart remote controlled car to get that DC motor inside.

As I was in pre-final year (Because saying 3rd year doesn't give that kick), I was introduced to the **world of Micro-controllers, SBC's and the maker community**, oh god was I happy?! You should have seen my face.

_Just a depiction_

I've searched for arduino kits online and stumbled upon Quad store's "Super Starter Kit", which comes with a list of projects you can do and also the code, a great start for me.

_The Arduino Kit_

This included every possible componenets I didn't know I needed, untill I started doing projects, really a great kit.

### Components Included

_The components of the kit_

The Kit included:
* Arduino Uno R3
* Breadboard (Full-size)
* Breadboard (Mini)
* Expansion Shield
* Push Buttons
* ULN2003 Driver
* Stepper Motor
* Breadboard power supply
* IR Remote
* Battery Holder
* Vibration switch
* flame sensor
* DHT11 sensor
* Photo-resistor
* IR Receiver
* Potentiometer
* 16*2 LCD (Without I2C module)
* Active Buzzer
* Passive Buzzer
* HC SR04
* IC 74HC595
* 1 Digit Display
* 4 Digit Display
* 8*8 Dot Matrix
* Resistors (220, 330, 10k and 1k ohms)
* Jumper wires
* RGB Module
* LEDs
* 40 pin Header
* Jumpers (F-F and M-M)
* SG90 Servo motor

Almost around 20 components, trust me, I didn't know what they did, when I bought them, I've figured it out, you'll figure it out somehow too.

Somehow, that kid who tore apart remote-control cars just to see the DC motors at work came back to life when he saw Stepper and Servo motors. Talk about a step-up!
