Hey, I’m **Samarth Gowda**. I’m an **Electrical and Electronics Engineering student**, but honestly, I’ve always been more into figuring stuff out than just reading textbooks. Ever since I was a kid, I tore apart gadgets just to see how they worked. That curiosity never went away—it just grew bigger, crazier and… well, messier. And trust me, *a lot messier*.  

These days, my world is a mix of **Arduino, C, juggling through different linux distros (I don't use Arch), Python, VHDL, KiCad, SBCs and sometimes Blender & animation**. One day I’m debugging code for a microcontroller, the next I’m designing a PCB, and the day after I’m rendering something in 3D just because I can. Sometimes I feel like I’m juggling ten different worlds at once, but honestly, that chaos is what makes it fun (stress included, of course).  

This blog is my way of documenting everything, the wins, the fails, and the classic “why is this not working?!” moments. I’m building circuits, writing code, creating simulations, reading up on tech and some fiction here and there and learning along the way. It’s messy, I know and it’s all me figuring out how to bring ideas to life. I'm still figuring out life too.  

At the same time, my eyes are on the bigger game: **micro & nanoelectronics, CPUs, GPUs, VLSI**, and designing things at the tiniest scale possible. I want to understand how these insanely complex things tick, create stuff that matters, and maybe inspire others to tinker like crazy too.  

So yeah… that’s me: curious & chaotic, failing a lot, trying to learn everything at the same time (unbalanced is how I work), but loving every second of it. If you’re into tech, electronics, coding, animation, or just exploring how things come alive, this is my playground and you’re welcome to peek in.
